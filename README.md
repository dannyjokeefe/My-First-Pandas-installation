# Learning Pandas with Python (Google Colab)

This project documents my journey learning **pandas**, one of the most powerful Python libraries for data analysis. Using **Google Colab**, I explored how to work with structured data efficiently by loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing datasets.

## 📚 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to get hands-on practice with the most essential pandas features, including:

- Creating and exploring DataFrames
- Importing data from CSV files
- Cleaning and transforming datasets
- Performing basic analysis and summary statistics
- Sorting, filtering, and grouping data
- Visualizing data trends using built-in pandas plotting

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- 📥 **Data Importing**: Read datasets from CSV files using `pd.read_csv()`
- 🔍 **Exploratory Analysis**: Used `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()` for data inspection
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values with `.fillna()`, `.dropna()`, and type conversions
- 📊 **Filtering & Selection**: Queried rows and columns with Boolean indexing and `.loc[]` / `.iloc[]`
- 🔄 **Data Transformation**: Created new columns, applied functions with `.apply()` and lambda expressions
- 📈 **Grouping & Aggregation**: Summarized data using `.groupby()`, `.agg()`, and pivot tables
- 🗂 **Sorting & Organizing**: Sorted data by multiple columns using `.sort_values()`
- 📉 **Basic Visualization**: Generated quick plots using `df.plot()` for line, bar, and histogram views
- ⚙️ **Google Colab Proficiency**: Managed code, outputs, and markdown effectively in an interactive notebook
